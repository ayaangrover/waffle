Waffle is a group chat app. It is end-to-end encrypted, uses firebase's secure protocols to ensure user data is safe, and uses google to sign in. I used SwiftUI to build the app. This is my second app in swift/swiftui. The first one I used tutorials and AI to understand, but for Waffle the code is entirely my own.
