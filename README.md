Waffle is a group chat app. It is end-to-end encrypted, uses firebase's secure protocols to ensure user data is safe, and uses google to sign in. I used SwiftUI to build the app. This is my second app in swift/swiftui. The documentation is at [akg.mintlify.app](https://akg.mintlify.app) and the current server status is at [https://stats.uptimerobot.com/lSKnswJSGz](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/lSKnswJSGz).
